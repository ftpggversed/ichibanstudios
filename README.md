Ichiban studios is an anime streaming service coming soon. 
it was originally gonna be like netflix with big anime like naruto, seven deadly sins, etc
but i reached out to a little short of 100 different studios in japan and have not recieved an email back so guess what! 
this goes out to the anime community, when the site is completed you will be able to upload your own shows, your own content for others to see ^^
this might take a while its been almoat 5 years since i started this site however i am just one lonely man
no dev team behind my back (atm). i have to learn new things and add everything myself. so please be patient
